# IAM System API Testing Guide

✅ **LATEST TESTING STATUS: ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL** (Last tested: 2025-07-30)

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the IAM (Identity and Access Management) system API using Postman.

## 🧪 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS

**TESTING COMPLETED:** All major IAM system endpoints thoroughly tested and validated

### ✅ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
- **POST /api/auth/register** - ✅ Working (User creation with JWT)
- **POST /api/auth/login** - ✅ Working (Authentication with JWT token)
- **JWT Middleware** - ✅ Working (Route protection and user attachment)
- **Invalid Token Handling** - ✅ Working (Proper error responses)
- **Missing Token Handling** - ✅ Working (Authentication required messages)

### ✅ CORE CRUD OPERATIONS (All Permission-Protected)
- **Users CRUD** - ✅ All working (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Groups CRUD** - ✅ All working (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- **Roles CRUD** - ✅ All working (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Modules CRUD** - ✅ All working (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## 📦 Files Included
- `IAM_System_Complete.postman_collection.json` - Complete API collection with all endpoints
- `IAM_System.postman_environment.json` - Environment variables for easy configuration
- `POSTMAN_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - This testing guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Import Files into Postman
1. Open Postman
2. Click **Import** button
3. Import both JSON files:
   - `IAM_System_Complete.postman_collection.json`
   - `IAM_System.postman_environment.json`

### 2. Select Environment
1. In Postman, select **"IAM System Environment"** from the environment dropdown (top-right)
2. Verify the `base_url` is set to `http://localhost:3000/api`

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Server should start on `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔐 Authentication Workflow

### Step 1: Login as Admin
1. Go to **🔐 Authentication → Login User**
2. Use default admin credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "admin@example.com",
     "password": "Admin123!"
   }
   ```
3. Send the request
4. JWT token will be automatically saved to environment variables

### Step 2: Verify Authentication
1. Go to **🛡️ Access Control → Get My Permissions**
2. Send request to verify you have all 24 permissions
3. This confirms the admin user has full system access

## 📊 Testing Workflow

### 🎯 Recommended Testing Order

#### 1. **Authentication Tests**
- ✅ Register User (optional - creates new user)
- ✅ Login User (required - get JWT token)

#### 2. **Core Entity CRUD Tests**
Test each entity in this order:

**👤 Users Management**
- Get All Users
- Get User by ID
- Create User
- Update User
- Delete User

**👥 Groups Management**
- Get All Groups
- Create Group
- Get Group by ID
- Update Group
- Delete Group

**🎭 Roles Management**
- Get All Roles
- Create Role
- Get Role by ID
- Update Role
- Delete Role

**📦 Modules Management**
- Get All Modules
- Create Module
- Get Module by ID
- Update Module
- Delete Module

**🔑 Permissions Management**
- Get All Permissions
- Create Permission
- Get Permission by ID
- Update Permission
- Delete Permission

#### 3. **Relationship Management Tests**

**🔗 User-Group Assignments**
- Assign Users to Group
- Get Users in Group
- Get User's Groups
- Remove User from Group

**🎭 Group-Role Assignments**
- Assign Roles to Group
- Get Roles in Group
- Get Role's Groups
- Remove Role from Group

**🔑 Role-Permission Assignments**
- Assign Permissions to Role
- Get Permissions in Role
- Get Permission's Roles
- Remove Permission from Role

#### 4. **Access Control Tests**
- Get My Permissions
- Simulate Action (test different module/action combinations)

## 🧪 Sample Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create Complete User Workflow
1. **Create User** → Create a new user
2. **Create Group** → Create "Developers" group
3. **Create Role** → Create "Developer" role
4. **Assign User to Group** → Add user to Developers group
5. **Assign Role to Group** → Add Developer role to Developers group
6. **Assign Permissions to Role** → Give specific permissions to Developer role
7. **Login as New User** → Test the new user's access
8. **Get My Permissions** → Verify inherited permissions

### Scenario 2: Permission Testing
1. **Create Limited Role** → Role with only "read" permissions
2. **Assign to Group** → Create group with limited role
3. **Assign User** → Add user to limited group
4. **Test Access** → Login as limited user and test various actions
5. **Simulate Actions** → Use simulate-action endpoint to test permissions (requires userId, moduleId, action)

### Scenario 3: Hierarchy Testing
1. **Create Multiple Groups** → Admin, Manager, Employee groups
2. **Create Role Hierarchy** → Super Admin, Manager, Viewer roles
3. **Assign Different Permissions** → Different permission sets per role
4. **Test Inheritance** → Verify users inherit correct permissions

## 🔍 Key Testing Points

### ✅ Authentication
- [ ] Register new users successfully
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] JWT token automatically saved and used
- [ ] Protected routes require authentication
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected

### ✅ CRUD Operations
- [ ] All entities support full CRUD operations
- [ ] Validation errors are properly returned
- [ ] Data persistence works correctly
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes returned

### ✅ Relationships
- [ ] Users can be assigned to multiple groups
- [ ] Groups can have multiple roles
- [ ] Roles can have multiple permissions
- [ ] Relationships can be created and removed

### ✅ Access Control
- [ ] Permission inheritance works through groups
- [ ] Users get permissions from all their groups' roles
- [ ] Simulate action correctly predicts access
- [ ] Protected routes enforce permissions

### ✅ Data Integrity
- [ ] Unique constraints enforced (usernames, emails)
- [ ] Foreign key relationships maintained
- [ ] Cascade deletes work properly
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid entries

## 📝 Important Endpoint Notes

### Simulate Action Endpoint
The **Simulate Action** endpoint requires specific parameters:
```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "moduleId": 1,
  "action": "create"
}
```
- `userId`: ID of the user to test permissions for
- `moduleId`: ID of the module (1=Users, 2=Groups, 3=Roles, 4=Modules, 5=Permissions, 6=Assignments)
- `action`: One of "create", "read", "update", "delete"

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Authentication required" errors
**Solution:** Ensure you've logged in and JWT token is saved to environment

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:** Login as admin user who has all permissions

### Issue: "User not found" errors
**Solution:** Check that auto-seeding created the admin user on server startup

### Issue: Server connection errors
**Solution:** Verify server is running on `http://localhost:3000`

## 📊 Expected Default Data

After server startup, you should have:
- **6 Modules**: Users, Groups, Roles, Modules, Permissions, Assignments
- **24 Permissions**: CRUD operations for each module (6 × 4 = 24)
- **1 Role**: Super Admin (with all 24 permissions)
- **1 Group**: Administrators (with Super Admin role)
- **1 User**: admin@example.com (in Administrators group)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your IAM system is working correctly if:
- ✅ All authentication endpoints work
- ✅ All CRUD operations succeed for all entities
- ✅ Relationship assignments work properly
- ✅ Permission inheritance functions correctly
- ✅ Access control enforces proper restrictions
- ✅ Admin user has access to all operations
- ✅ New users inherit permissions through group membership

## 🔧 Advanced Testing

### Custom Scenarios
1. **Multi-Group User**: Create user in multiple groups with different roles
2. **Role Overlap**: Test users with overlapping permissions from different roles
3. **Permission Revocation**: Remove permissions and verify access is revoked
4. **Inactive Entities**: Test with isActive=false entities

### Performance Testing
1. **Bulk Operations**: Create many entities to test performance
2. **Complex Queries**: Test filtering and pagination with large datasets
3. **Concurrent Access**: Test multiple users accessing system simultaneously
